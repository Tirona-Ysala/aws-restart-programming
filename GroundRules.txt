Python is a case sensitive language - 'A' is not seen as 'a'

Variables are a way of storing a value. Put simply it is a name that represents a value
Rules for naming variables in Python
1. Variables should not have spaces - date of birth (invalid), date_of_birth (valid)
2. Variables do not start with numbers - 12strong, 1hundred (invalid), strong_12, hundred1, ten2two (valid)
3. Variables should not be the same with keywords or reserverd words (identifiers)
4. Variables cannot take in special characters - !@#$%^&*(){}|,./

When there is an opening ther should also be a closing
[close]
"your"
'brackets'
(always)
